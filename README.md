# FoodExplorer
A Shiny web application to browse food nutrition facts.

__Tools/packages used__: 
- Python (IPython & Pandas for data cleaning)
- R (ggplot, data.table, Shiny Dashboard)

The app can be accessed at https://jonathanliu.shinyapps.io/FoodExplorerV5/

This repository stores all the source codes that were used to build my Shiny web application.
The dataset of food nutrition facts came from __http://world.openfoodfacts.org/__, a open sourced food fact project that contributed purely by volunteers.
