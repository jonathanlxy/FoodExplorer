# FoodExplorer
A Shiny web application to browse food nutrition facts.

This repository stores all the source codes that were used to build my Shiny web application.
The dataset of food nutrition facts came from __http://world.openfoodfacts.org/__, a open sourced food fact project that contributed purely by volunteers.
